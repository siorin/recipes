Ingredients

topping
2 tablespoons brown sugar (Taiwan ‘black’ sugar is best)
1/2 teaspoon gelatine
2 tablespoons boiling water
custard
2 1/2 cups full cream milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 egg yolks
1/4 cup of white fine (castor) sugar
1 package gelatine (14g)

Method

1. Combine the brown sugar and gelatine in a bowl. Pour over the boiling water and still to dissolve. Spoon into small glasses, pudding dishes or pudding glasses and set aside to cool. If you have time, refrigerate overnight.
2. Pour the milk into a saucepan, add the vanilla and cook over a low heat until it begins to simmer (i.e. a few bubbles but not quite boiling).
3. In a separate, medium sized bowl beat the egg yolks and sugar until pale and thick. They will increase in volumne.
4. Gradually pour the hot milk mixture onto the eggs, whisking constantly. The mixture will start to look like a buttercup coloured milkshake.
5. Then transfer the milk and egg mixture back into a clean saucepan. Cook over a low heat, stirring constantly, for around five minutes or until slightly thickened.
6. For a more professional and smooth texture, strain the egg mixture through a colander. 
7. Dissolve the contents of the gelatine packet in a small amount of hot (boiling) water. Add to the hot custard mixture and stir until combined.
8. Transfer the custard into a pouring jug, and allow to cool slightly. Then carefully pour on top of the brown sugar jelly layer on the bottom on the pudding glasses. Allow to set, and refrigerate until needed. Enjoy!
